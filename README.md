# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other in a classic 3x3 grid, keeping the gameplay straightforward and fun.

## About the Project

This project was developed as one of my contributions while being a member of the **MSc MSIT Web Development Team**. I am currently an active participant in the team, and this project demonstrates my ability to combine core web technologies to implement interactive browser games.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game board
- Two-player gameplay
- Visual feedback for winning and draw scenarios
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Player 1 uses "X", Player 2 uses "O".
3. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks.
4. The first to get three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all cells are filled and thereâ€™s no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the game board and interface
- **CSS** for styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** for handling game logic and interactions

## Project Status

This project represents one of my web development works as part of the MSc MSIT Web Development Team. I am excited to continue learning and contributing to more collaborative projects!
